/**
 * capture-gate-v3.test.mjs — Loop 8.
 *
 * Locks the v3 capture-gate root-cause fix: the actionable-signal scan now runs
 * over the FULL text + each decimal-safe sentence fragment, so a directive in
 * sentence 2+ is seen — WITHOUT re-admitting the Loop-7 true-noise items.
 *
 * Two invariant classes are asserted here:
 *   1. RECALL (new behavior): soft corrections v2 wrongly rejected are accepted.
 *   2. PRECISION FLOOR (must NOT regress): every Loop-7 true-noise / system
 *      fragment is STILL rejected.
