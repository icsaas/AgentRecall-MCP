//
// Loop 11 — deterministic test of the CROSS-PROJECT TRANSFER INSTRUMENT.
//
// This tests the METRIC, not the real-corpus outcome. CI must be deterministic,
// so we build SYNTHETIC multi-project corpora with a known character:
//   - a correction whose CLASS also appears in ANOTHER project MUST score a HIT
//     (the class was already seen elsewhere → anticipatable cold / zero-shot);
//   - a correction whose CLASS is UNIQUE to its own project MUST score a MISS
//     (novel to the rest of the corpus → unanticipatable cross-project);
//   - the end-to-end verdict is UNTESTABLE when there are too few held-out
//     testables, and a MEASURED-RATE string when there are enough.
//
// A passing real-corpus run is NOT asserted anywhere — a low / untestable real
// result is a valid finding, decided by cross-project-transfer.mjs separately.
