// packages/core/test/query-memory-pipeline.test.mjs — Wave 2 (2026-08-30,
// reports/2026-08-29-pipe-w2-query-report.md, plywood SOP ecbd4351).
//
// Wave 1 built `readTierCandidates()` (retrieval/candidates.ts) as a shared
// reader with trust-tagging baked in, but shipped it as a LEAF UTILITY —
// nothing was forced to call it. Wave 2's whole point is to make it a
// MANDATORY PIPELINE STAGE instead. This file proves that claim three ways:
//
//   PART A — SECURITY DESTINATION-PROOF: plants the red-team CRITICAL-2
//   shape (a rescue-tagged file with a fabricated H1-style title/injection
//   payload) directly inside a PALACE ROOM — the surface
//   identity-trust-completeness.test.mjs's ALLOWLIST_PALACE explicitly names
//   as smart_recall's OWN KNOWN GAP before this wave ("(KNOWN GAP)
//   tools-logic/palace-search.ts ... This is the PRIMARY room-content
//   retrieval surface Wave 2's queryMemory() migration should prioritize.")
//   — and proves the migrated smart_recall() no longer surfaces it at all
//   (absent, which trivially satisfies "never ranks #1"). Also re-confirms
//   the journal-sourced case (already covered end-to-end by
//   identity-trust-completeness.test.mjs's Part A, but re-asserted here
//   directly against queryMemory() itself, one layer lower, as the
//   pipeline's own regression guard rather than relying solely on smart-
//   recall's downstream behavior).
//
//   PART B — COMPLETENESS / NON-BYPASSABILITY: calls `queryMemory()` DIRECTLY
//   (not via smartRecall()) with a fixture containing BOTH a rescue-tagged
//   and a genuine candidate in the SAME tier, and asserts the trust-filter
//   stage runs unconditionally — a caller cannot construct a `queryMemory()`
//   call that skips it (there is no option to disable it). Non-vacuity: the
//   SAME fixture shape, with the rescue tag removed, DOES surface — proving
//   the filter is discriminating on the tag, not just returning nothing.
//
//   PART C — FENCE STAGE: `queryMemory()`'s own `renderFenced()` (pipeline
//   stage 6) actually calls fenceMemory() and produces bracketed output —
//   proving the pipeline HAS a working fence stage, even though smart_recall
//   (this wave's only migrated caller) does not invoke it — see
//   query-memory.ts's own `QueryMemoryResult.renderFenced` doc comment for
//   why that specific caller is a deliberate, documented exception (its
//   fencing already happens correctly one layer up, at the MCP-tool wrapper,
//   per the shipped P1 fence architecture).

  // number-shaped prose that is never a genuine version (IP addresses,
  // dot-formatted dates, dotted step numbers), and when it does, the
  // multiplicative penalty INVERTS ranking — demoting a correct, unrelated
  // fact below a weaker match. FIXED (see query-memory.ts's
  // `applyContradictionStage` and contradiction.ts's own header): the stage
  // is now ANNOTATE-ONLY (no score change, no re-sort — E1 below is updated
  // accordingly, asserting order is UNCHANGED, not flipped) and the grammar
  // itself is now HIGH-PRECISION (requires an explicit version marker,
  // rejects IPv4-shaped trailing groups — E11/E12/E13 below are the new
  // false-positive-exclusion proofs; E1/E4/E5 already prove the real
  // version case still detects).
  //
  // Every fixture below deliberately places the STALE candidate's exactness
  // match strictly stronger than the current one — both fixture dates are
  // many months old relative to "today", so the Ebbinghaus recency term is
  // negligible for both (S=2's decay floors near-zero well within days,
  // never mind months), leaving keyword-exactness as the dominant term.
  // Pre-STEP-4 this made the stale item rank ABOVE current on raw score
  // alone, which the (now-removed) down-rank+re-sort mechanism corrected;
