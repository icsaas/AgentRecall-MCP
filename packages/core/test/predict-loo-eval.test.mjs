// fixture corpus we build in a temp root — NOT the real ~/.agent-recall corpus
// (the script does that separately and prints a report). These tests assert the
// harness RUNS correctly and that the ANTI-SELF-CONFIRMATION guard holds. They
// deliberately do NOT assert any minimum precision/recall on real data — a low
// real-corpus score is a valid, honest result, not a test failure.

/**
 * Build a synthetic corpus engineered so the blind LOO predictor fires AND hits:
 *   - project "deploy-proj": three same-cluster P0 corrections about deploying
 *     to staging before production, dated on consecutive days. The third (and
 *     later a fourth) have prior siblings → predictable, and their redacted
 *     lead-in (context minus the rule) keeps the shared trigger keywords so the
 *     blind profile fires a risk anchored to an EARLIER sibling (a DIFFERENT
 *     correction than C) — proving the structural anti-self-confirm property.
 *   - project "lonely-proj": one isolated correction → not predictable, never
 *     fires (exercises the honest "uncomputable / zero" branches).
