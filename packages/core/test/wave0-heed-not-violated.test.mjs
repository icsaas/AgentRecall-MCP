/**
 * wave0-heed-not-violated.test.mjs — Wave 0 measurement fix (2026-08-29),
 * heed-rate credit model Option A (reports/2026-08-29-heed-design.md).
 *
 * Proves the additive-only contract the design decision requires:
 *   1. recordOutcome("not_violated") increments ONLY its own counter
 *      (not_violated_count) — heeded_count/recurrence_count/precision/
 *      proof_confidence are byte-identical before and after.
 *   2. getCorrectionKPIs sums not_violated_count for VISIBILITY only —
 *      heeded/recurred/precision are unaffected by its presence.
 *   3. The north-star `heed_rate = heeded/(heeded+recurred)` formula (lives
 *      in scripts/eval/rmr-report.mjs, cross-consistent with
 *      getCorrectionKPIs per c3-heed-instrumentation.test.mjs's own suite)
 *      is BYTE-IDENTICAL whether or not "not_violated" events exist in the
 *      ledger for OTHER corrections in the same project.
 *   4. Backward-compat: an on-disk correction record + ledger with ZERO
 *      not_violated history (pre-Option-A shape) loads and rebuilds fine —
 *      not_violated_count stays undefined, never throws.
 *   5. `ar outcomes rebuild --apply` (via runOutcomesRebuild) populates
 *      not_violated_count from the ledger for a record whose materialized
 *      counter is missing/stale, and is idempotent on a second run.
