/**
 * room-topics-content-quality.test.mjs — W5c (2026-08-31)
 *
 * BUG (L2 eval §3.3): session_start's active_rooms[].topics is derived from
 * `extractKeywords(meta.description, 4)` — but meta.description defaults to
 * the STATIC DEFAULT_PALACE_ROOMS template string and renders IDENTICALLY
 * whether a room has 10 real entries or 0. An empty, never-touched "Blockers"
 * room emitted the exact same "topics" an agent would read as meaningful
 * as a fully-populated one.
 *
 * FIX: suppress `topics` (omit the field entirely) when EITHER holds:
 *   - the room has zero real entries (countRoomEntries === 0), OR
 *   - meta.description is still byte-identical to the unedited
 *     DEFAULT_PALACE_ROOMS template string for that slug.
 * A room with real, edited content on BOTH axes still gets topics as before.
 *
 * Each scenario uses its own project slug for full isolation — no shared
 * state between the empty/default/real cases, and no reliance on
 * active_rooms' top-3-by-salience ordering beyond "the room under test is
 * the only non-empty (or highest-salience) room in its project".
