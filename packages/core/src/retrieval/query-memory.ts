/**
 * retrieval/query-memory.ts — Wave 2 of the shared retrieval pipeline
 * (reports/2026-08-21-architecture-review.md §4, reports/2026-08-29-kickoff-plan.md
 * Wave 2, plywood SOP ecbd4351).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS FILE FIXES: Wave 1 (retrieval/candidates.ts) built a shared
 * TYPED reader with trust-tagging baked in, but shipped it as a LEAF UTILITY —
 * nothing was forced to call it. The architecture review's whole point is that
 * a leaf utility gets forgotten by exactly the surfaces that matter most. This
 * file is the fix: a MANDATORY PIPELINE every candidate is forced through
 * before it can be ranked or surfaced — `queryMemory()` composes six stages
 * (fetch -> trust-filter -> tokenize+score -> scope -> rank/fuse -> fence) and
 * NO stage is individually callable/skippable by a consumer; a caller gets
 * `queryMemory()`'s return value or nothing.
 *
 * WAVE 2 SCOPE: build the pipeline, then migrate exactly ONE caller onto it —
 * `smartRecall()` (tools-logic/smart-recall.ts). journalSearch, palaceSearch,
 * recallInsight, resurrect, session_start are UNCHANGED this wave (Wave 3).
 *
 * ── CHALLENGE (a): one canonical scoring formula, or pluggable per tier? ──
 * PLUGGABLE PER TIER — confirmed, not unified. smart-recall.ts's own file
 * header (still true, read in full before writing this file) spends 100 lines
 * justifying why journal (Ebbinghaus S=2, fast episodic decay), palace
 * (S=9999, salience-weighted, near-zero decay) and insight (confirmation-count
 * driven, not time-based at all) encode three genuinely different memory-type
 * semantics — collapsing them into one formula would not be "reconciliation",
 * it would be the same cross-source-raw-score-averaging bug smart-recall.ts's
 * own Fix 1 (RRF) already fixed once, reintroduced one level up. What DOES
 * unify into "ONE score stage" is the STAGE itself (TOKENIZE+SCORE as one named
 * step in the pipeline, always run, never skippable) with an internal per-tier
 * strategy table (`scoreJournalTier`/`scorePalaceTier`/`scoreInsightTier`
 * below) — this is exactly the architecture review's own §4.2 step 3 wording:
 * "applies one scoring strategy per tier ... no scoring behavior needs to
 * change on day one." The five formulas smart-recall.ts documents (RRF k=60,
 * Ebbinghaus, hot-window recency, betaUtility feedback, two-stage fusion) are
 * split by WHERE they belong in a genuinely reusable pipeline, not merged:
 *   - RRF (two-stage: applyRRF + fuseCanonical) + hot-window recency:
 *     pipeline-owned (RANK/FUSE stage below) — generic to any date-bearing,
 *     multi-tier candidate set, not smart_recall-specific.
 *   - Ebbinghaus decay, palace salience/IDF blend, insight confirmation blend:
 *     pipeline-owned (TOKENIZE+SCORE stage, per-tier) — these ARE the
 *     per-tier strategies the review names.
 *   - betaUtility feedback multiplier + calibratedConfidence labeling:
 *     LEFT IN smart-recall.ts, NOT pulled into the pipeline. Both are
 *     smart_recall-SPECIFIC concepts (a user feedback log keyed by
 *     result id/title; a confidence scale built to compare smart_recall's
 *     OWN local-vs-remote backends) that no other Wave-3 migration target
 *     (journalSearch, palaceSearch, resurrect, session_start) has any
 *     equivalent of today. Baking them into queryMemory() would force every
 *     future consumer to inherit smart_recall's own feedback-log semantics
 *     whether or not they make sense for that surface — exactly the
 *     "leaf utility everyone must remember NOT to blindly trust" anti-pattern
 *     this effort exists to close, just relocated one level deeper. They stay
 *     as smart-recall.ts's OWN post-pipeline processing, applied uniformly to
 *     whatever queryMemory() returns.
 *
 * ── CHALLENGE (b): the Wave-1 superset — what does smart_recall now SEE? ──
 * readTierCandidates("palace-room", ...) surfaces every `.md` file in a room,
 * whereas the OLD smart-recall.ts called `palaceSearch()` directly, which has
 * a KNOWN, DOCUMENTED gap (packages/core/test/identity-trust-completeness.test.mjs's
 * `ALLOWLIST_PALACE["tools-logic/palace-search.ts"]`, marked "(KNOWN GAP)"):
 * palaceSearch() never calls the rescue-quarantine choke, so a rescue-tagged
 * file planted in a room would have surfaced through smart_recall's OLD palace
 * source completely unfiltered. Wave 2's migration CLOSES this gap for the
 * smart_recall path specifically (see `scorePalaceTier` below: trust-filter
 * runs before scoring, unconditionally) — a genuine, characterized SECURITY
 * IMPROVEMENT, not a neutral refactor; see this file's own destination-proof
 * test (retrieval/query-memory.test.mjs) for the planted-rescue-content proof.
 * `palaceSearch()` itself (the standalone MCP tool / `ar palace search`
 * surface) is UNCHANGED and still carries the gap — only smart_recall's
 * INTERNAL route to palace-room content no longer does. This wave's report
 * updates identity-trust-completeness.test.mjs's ALLOWLIST_PALACE entry for
 * palace-search.ts to say so precisely (the function is still a known gap;
 * smart-recall.ts no longer calls it).
 *
 * Week-summaries / rollup-archive: smart-recall.ts's journal source already
 * reads rollup-archive today (journalSearch(...) internally calls
 * `journalDirs(slug, true)`) — `scoreJournalTier` below defaults
 * `includeRollupArchive: true` to match, so this is NOT new surface area, it
 * is preserved surface area.
 *
 * Raw-archive: NOT part of the competing tier set here (see the "archive
 * never enters RRF" note on `queryArchiveFallback` below) — unchanged
 * structurally, just relocated into this module.
 *
 * ── CHALLENGE (c): where "exact equivalence" genuinely cannot hold ──
 * Documented per-decision below, not glossed over:
 *   1. FENCE (stage 6) is NOT applied inside this pipeline to `smart_recall`'s
 *      per-item fields. See `renderFenced()`'s doc comment — forcing
 *      `fenceMemory()` onto every candidate excerpt would corrupt
 *      `SmartRecallResultItem.excerpt` (breaking the very "preserve external
 *      contract exactly" requirement this wave is graded on) AND double-fence
 *      the payload, since `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/{smart-recall,recall}.ts`
 *      ALREADY correctly call `fenceMemory()` ONCE around the whole rendered
 *      payload at the true MCP-tool surfacing boundary (P1 fence, TOW2-388,
 *      predates this wave). This is a genuine architectural conflict between
 *      the SOP's literal "fence as the final stage" wording and the
 *      already-shipped, already-tested, more-correct fencing architecture —
 *      resolved in favor of the shipped architecture; see `renderFenced()`.
 *   2. Journal-tier truncation order: the OLD `journalSearch()` applies its
 *      `limit` cutoff DURING an unsorted (raw `readdirSync` order)
 *      directory/file/line traversal, THEN sorts by date descending — so
 *      when total matches exceed `limit`, WHICH matches survive depends on
 *      filesystem enumeration order, not recency. `scoreJournalTier` below
 *      iterates `readTierCandidates`'s already-date-sorted-descending live
 *      half first — a characterized IMPROVEMENT (more predictable, favors
 *      recency, matches the tier's own Ebbinghaus-decay intent), not a
 *      silent behavior change. CORRECTION (independent review, W2,
 *      2026-08-30): this file's initial cut only sorted the live half — the
 *      rollup-archive half (candidates.ts) and the legacy-journal half
 *      (`readLegacyJournalCandidates` below) were still built in raw,
 *      filesystem-enumeration order before being concatenated on, so a
 *      truncation that spilled into either half would still keep an
 *      arbitrary subset rather than the newest. Both halves are now ALSO
 *      sorted date-descending before concatenation — the sort-before-
 *      truncate class is closed across live AND archive (and legacy).
 *      SCOPE OF EQUIVALENCE (independent review, W2, 2026-08-30): this
 *      archive/legacy date-desc sort is an INTENTIONAL ranking change, and
 *      it is NOT order-preserving even below the truncation limit. When two
 *      candidates carry TIED per-tier scores (realistic for similarly-aged
 *      archive entries whose Ebbinghaus-decay scores coincide), `applyRRF`'s
 *      rank/`score` is decided by array position, so re-sorting the archive
 *      half changes the tie-break order — and the resulting numeric RRF
 *      `score` — of the tied items, even when nothing is truncated. This is
 *      a deterministic recency-favoring improvement over the prior
 *      arbitrary-filesystem-order tie-break, NOT a byte-identical no-op.
 *      Only STEP 1 (the `includeUntrusted` reconciliation below) is
 *      byte-identical; this sort is not, and the report's equivalence
 *      section is scoped accordingly.
 *   3. Legacy journal directory (`~/.claude/projects/<entry>/memory/journal/` —
 *      `storage/paths.ts`'s `journalDirs()` legacy-fallback branch): Wave 1's
 *      `readTierCandidates` does NOT cover this (confirmed by reading
 *      candidates.ts — it never imports `getLegacyRoot`). `journalSearch()`
 *      today DOES scan it (via `journalDirs(slug, true)`). Rather than
 *      silently dropping this surface for smart_recall (a real, if likely
 *      rare, regression) or re-opening Wave 1's already-merged, already-tested
 *      `candidates.ts` to add it there, this file adds a small, self-contained
 *      `readLegacyJournalCandidates()` below that mirrors `journalDirs()`'s own
 *      legacy-root traversal — closing the gap without touching Wave 1's file.
 *      Also now sorted date-descending before returning (see item 2's
 *      correction above) — it is a third half of the same journal-tier
 *      concatenation, not exempt from the same truncation hazard.
 *
 * ── SCOPE NOTE (independent review, W2, 2026-08-30) ──
 * CRITICAL-2 (rescue-quarantine injection) is closed for `smart_recall` this
 * wave. `palaceSearch()` / `resurrect()` / `session_start()` remain on their
 * own pre-pipeline paths and are UNCHANGED — they carry whatever
 * trust-filtering (or lack of it) they had before this wave. Do not read
 * this file's fixes as closing the gap workspace-wide.
 *
 * ── WAVE 3b UPDATE (2026-08-30, reports/2026-08-30-pipe-w3b-migrate-report.md) ──
 * `journalSearch()` and `recallInsight()` are now migrated onto this
 * pipeline (journalSearch's primary journal scan via `queryMemory({tiers:
 * ["journal"]})`; recallInsight() shares this file's `applyScope` — see
 * `./scope.ts` — directly on its own `recallInsights()` call, without
 * routing through `queryMemory()` itself, to avoid corrupting its external
 * contract's `relevance`/`applies_when`/`confirmed`/`file` fields, which
 * `QueryMemoryItem` does not carry). `palaceSearch()` / `resurrect()` /
 * `session_start()` remain unmigrated — see the Wave 3b report's resurrect
 * assessment for why `resurrect()` in particular is a RECOMMENDATION, not a
 * migration, this wave.
 *
 * ── WAVE 5a UPDATE (2026-08-31, reports/2026-08-31-pipe-w5a-contradiction-
 * report.md) ──
 * A new CONTRADICTION stage (`./contradiction.ts`'s `detectContradictions`)
 * now runs per-tier, immediately after TOKENIZE+SCORE and before RANK/FUSE
 * (see `applyContradictionStage` below) — for `journal` and `palace` tiers
 * ONLY (the `insight` tier has no per-item authored-date signal to resolve a
 * direction with, so it is deliberately skipped this wave, not silently
 * inherited). It reuses `helpers/conflict-scan.ts`'s existing version/
 * status/kv token grammar — the SAME grammar `tools-logic/supersession.ts`
 * already reuses for the separate `ar correct` flow — to find, within one
 * tier's own already-scored candidate list, pairs that assert the same
 * fact-key with a different value. A candidate detected as the STALE side
 * of such a pair is DOWN-RANKED (multiplicative score penalty, mirroring
 * `applyHotWindowBoost`'s pattern) and ANNOTATED (`supersededBy`) — it is
 * NEVER removed from the set. This closes part of the reconciliation gap
 * `reports/2026-08-18-eval-redteam.md`'s HIGH-2 finding named (0% of
 * grammar-detectable contradictions were previously surfaced with any
 * corrective signal) for the subset of that gap the existing grammar can
 * actually see — semantic-prose contradictions (that same finding's own
 * PostgreSQL→CockroachDB example) remain out of reach; see
 * `./contradiction.ts`'s header for why, and this wave's report for the
 * follow-up.

 * Insight tier: fetches directly from `recallInsights()`

 * store, not raw retrievable file content, so there is no
 * MemoryCandidate/trust-tag notion for this tier; every insight item is
 * `untrusted: false` by construction, a deliberate, documented decision —
 * not an oversight). Scoring formula ported verbatim from smart-recall.ts.
 *
 * Wave 3b (2026-08-30) change: previously fetched via the tools-logic
 * `recallInsight()` wrapper, which (a) never threaded `project` through to
 * `recallInsights()`'s own project-correlation boost — the SAME missing-
 * project-boost gap this wave's report names for `recallInsight()` itself,
 * fixed here too since it is the same root cause (`recallInsights()` never
 * receiving a `currentProject` argument), not two separate bugs — and (b)
 * stripped `IndexedInsight.projects` from its returned shape entirely,
 * making the SCOPE stage impossible to wire for this tier (there would be
 * nothing to filter by). Calling `recallInsights()` directly here also
 * removes this file's former dependency on tools-logic/recall-insight.ts —
 * recall-insight.ts now depends the OTHER direction (on `./scope.ts`, which
 * this file also uses), avoiding a circular import that routing THROUGH
 * `recallInsight()` in both directions would have created.
 *
 * CHARACTERIZED, non-substantive precision note: `recallInsight()`'s own
 * output rounds `relevance` to 2 decimal places before this tier used to
 * re-normalize it (`i.relevance / maxRelevance`). Reading `recallInsights()`
 * directly uses the UNROUNDED relevance number instead — a strictly more
 * precise input to the same ratio, not a behavior change any caller could
 * observe (`internalScore` differences are sub-0.005, far below anything
 * that could flip an RRF rank order in practice, and no test in this
 * package asserts on this tier's exact internal `score` value).
