/**
 * retrieval/contradiction.ts — the CONTRADICTION pipeline stage (Wave 5a,
 * 2026-08-31, reports/2026-08-31-pipe-w5a-contradiction-report.md).
 *
 * ── W5a SALVAGE (2026-08-31, same date, "## W5a salvage" section of the same
 * report) ── An INDEPENDENT review (separate from — and after — the W5a
 * code-reviewer pass named below) passed the mechanism (down-rank+annotate+
 * never-drop, the re-sort→RRF propagation) but found the token grammar's
 * status/kv branches were false-positive-PRONE in a way that actively
 * defeats the stage's own safety intent, not merely "wider than ideal":
 *   - HIGH-1 (safeguard defeat): the status branch extracts categories via
 *     `extractStatusTokens`, which maps "blocked"/"stuck" to the SAME
 *     category (both → "blocked") — so category-EQUIVALENT common phrasing
 *     ("status: blocked" vs "status: stuck", genuinely the same fact) should
 *     never conflict. It didn't, by that safeguard's own design — but the
 *     status branch is un-keyed (see below) and the KV branch's own separate
 *     "key: value" extraction treats "status" as a literal KV KEY with
 *     "blocked"/"stuck" as different raw VALUES, flagging a conflict the
 *     status-category-equivalence check was specifically built to prevent.
 *     Two branches reusing overlapping vocabulary defeated each other.
 *   - HIGH-2 (generic-key false positive): both the kv branch and (to a
 *     narrower degree) the version branch key off whatever single word
 *     immediately precedes the value — "priority: high" (a marketing
 *     decision) vs "priority: low" (an unrelated cleanup task) share the
 *     generic key `priority` and got flagged conflicting despite being
 *     about entirely different topics; "key match" gave no topical
 *     protection at all for common one-word keys.
 *   - HIGH-3 (invisible annotation): `supersededBy`/`conflictsWith` never
 *     reached `SmartRecallResultItem`/`JournalSearchResult.results` — fixed
 *     separately, see smart-recall.ts's `localRecallSearch` and
 *     journal-search.ts's `journalSearch` field-list maps.
 *
 * FIX (this file): restrict `grammarConflict` to `extractVersionTokens`
 * ONLY — status and kv detection are REMOVED from this module entirely
 * (not just gated/pre-filtered). Semver (`\d+\.\d+\.\d+`) is a much
 * narrower, more self-describing pattern than a bare "word: word" or
 * status-category match — a shared key + differing semver value is a
 * strong, low-false-positive signal of a genuine version supersession, and
 * removing the other two branches removes HIGH-1 (the category-vs-KV
 * cross-branch defeat cannot happen when the KV branch does not exist) and
 * the dominant real-world instance of HIGH-2 (KV keys off ANY generic
 * one-word label — "priority", "status", "mode", "env" — a pattern that
 * recurs constantly in prose; a version-shaped `\d+\.\d+\.\d+` collision
 * between two topically-unrelated candidates is comparatively rare, though
 * not literally impossible — e.g. a shared generic key like "step 1.2.3" vs
 * "step 5.6.7" — an acknowledged, narrower residual risk, not claimed to be
 * zero). `extractStatusTokens`/`extractKVTokens` remain exported from
 * `helpers/conflict-scan.ts` and are UNCHANGED there — `conflict-scan.ts`'s
 * own `scanForConflicts` (the separate smart-remember pre-save warning flow)
 * and `tools-logic/supersession.ts`'s `compareForConflicts` (the separate
 * `ar correct` CorrectionRecord flow) both still use all three extractors;
 * this restriction applies ONLY to this module's pairwise same-tier
 * retrieval-time comparison, not to those other two, structurally distinct
 * consumers.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE, not a function inside query-memory.ts: mirrors
 * `retrieval/scope.ts`'s own precedent — a small, dependency-light, pure
 * comparator that query-memory.ts (this wave) consumes, and that a later
 * wave's caller (e.g. a future `recallInsight()`-style direct consumer) can
 * import without creating an import cycle back into query-memory.ts (which
 * already imports FROM tools-logic — see scope.ts's header for the exact
 * cycle this pattern avoids).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO (scope, read the eval fixtures before extending):
 * this comparator reuses ONLY `helpers/conflict-scan.ts`'s `extractVersionTokens`
 * semver extractor (post-salvage — see above; status/kv were removed, not
 * merely descoped from the start). It does NOT detect arbitrary
 * semantic-prose contradictions ("we fully migrated OFF Postgres to
 * CockroachDB" vs "we use Postgres") — confirmed empirically against the
 * redteam eval fixture (reports/2026-08-18-eval-redteam.md HIGH-2) while
 * resolving this wave's pre-loaded Challenge A: the version extractor
 * produces no matching key with differing values for that pair at all (no
 * version numbers appear in either sentence). Prose-semantic contradiction
 * detection is a genuinely harder, separate problem (conflict-scan.ts's own
 * header already says so) and is explicitly OUT of this wave's scope — see
 * the wave report's "prose-semantic gap" follow-up section, not silently
 * absorbed into this grammar.
 *
 * ALGORITHM: pairwise, O(n²) over one tier's already-scored item list (n is
 * a per-tier result count, bounded by `perTierLimit`, never the full corpus).
 * For every pair (i, j):
 *   1. GRAMMAR CHECK — same key across version tokens, different semver
 *      value → conflict. Symmetric (order of i/j does not matter for
 *      whether a conflict exists, only for which side is stale — see 2).
 *   2. DIRECTION — decide which side is stale, if determinable at all:
 *        - both items carry a `date` and the dates differ → the OLDER
 *          `date` is superseded by the newer one (journal's own authored-
 *          date semantics; this only requires "the two dates differ", so it
 *          applies to any date-bearing tier, not journal-specifically —
 *          journal simply always has a `date`, so this branch always fires
 *          for it unless two journal hits share the exact SAME date).
 *        - dates are equal, or one/both undefined, AND both items carry an
 *          `order` that differs → the LOWER `order` is superseded by the
 *          HIGHER `order` (append-order tie-break: palace's same-day-tie
 *          policy, per this wave's Challenge B — `order` is populated from
 *          the room file's LINE NUMBER for palace items only; journal items
 *          are deliberately NOT given an `order` value by this wave's
 *          query-memory.ts wiring, so a same-date journal tie falls through
 *          to the next bullet instead of guessing off line position, per
 *          the wave brief's literal instruction).
 *        - neither resolves → AMBIGUOUS: both sides are annotated as
 *          conflicting with each other, NEITHER is marked superseded, and
 *          (by construction, see query-memory.ts's stage) neither is
 *          penalized. Never guess which side to demote from no signal.
 *
 * NEVER DROPS: this module only classifies relations between items already
 * present in the input array — it never removes, reorders, or mutates the
 * input array itself (that is query-memory.ts's stage's job, immediately
 * downstream). A caller that ignores this module's output entirely gets
 * back the exact same candidate set it passed in.
 *
 * ── HIGH-PRECISION GRAMMAR (pre-ship red-team fix, STEP 4b, 2026-09-01,
 * wave/pipe-w5fix — correctness red-team, reports/2026-09-01-pipe-w5fix-
 * report.md) ──
 * The W5a-salvage grammar above (line ~45-46) already NAMED "step 1.2.3 vs
 * step 5.6.7" as "an acknowledged, narrower residual risk, not claimed to be
 * zero" — a second, independent (correctness, not security) red-team then
 * PROVED that risk is much wider and actively harmful, not narrow: the
 * plain `helpers/conflict-scan.ts` `extractVersionTokens` extractor's
 * `(?:v|@|version\s+)?` marker is OPTIONAL, so ANY bare `N.N.N`-shaped
 * digit run gets treated as a version — which false-positives on:
 *   - IP addresses: "at 10.0.0.1" / "at 10.0.1.5" (the first 3 octets of a
 *     dotted-quad ARE a valid `\d+\.\d+\.\d+` match on their own).
 *   - dot-formatted dates: "08.15.2026" / "08.16.2026" (MM.DD.YYYY is
 *     structurally IDENTICAL to a semver's `\d+\.\d+\.\d+` shape — nothing
 *     about the digits themselves can distinguish a date from a version).
 *   - dotted step/section numbers: "step 1.2.3" / "step 5.6.7".
 * Combined with the ORIGINAL (pre-STEP-4a) down-rank+re-sort mechanism, a
 * false-positive match like this didn't just add noise — it actively
 * INVERTED ranking, demoting a correct, unrelated fact below a weaker match.
 * STEP 4a (query-memory.ts's `applyContradictionStage`) already made a false
 * positive here harmless (annotate-only, never reorders/rescores) — this
 * fix is the SECOND, independent layer: shrink how often the false
 * positive fires AT ALL, so even the harmless annotation is rare and
 * meaningful rather than routinely wrong.
 *
 * `extractHighPrecisionVersionTokens` below is a LOCAL, module-scoped
 * extractor — a modified copy of `extractVersionTokens`'s regex, NOT an
 * edit to the shared `helpers/conflict-scan.ts` export. `extractVersionTokens`
 * itself is UNCHANGED and remains exactly as permissive as before for its
 * OTHER two callers (`conflict-scan.ts`'s own `scanForConflicts` — the
 * smart-remember pre-save warning flow — and `tools-logic/supersession.ts`'s
 * `compareForConflicts` — the `ar correct` CorrectionRecord flow), which are
 * structurally distinct consumers this fix's scope (the retrieval area) does
 * not touch and whose own false-positive tolerance was never in question
 * here (see this file's original header, "FIX (this file)", for why
 * `contradiction.ts` choosing a narrower grammar than `conflict-scan.ts`
 * offers was already the file's own precedent).
 *
 * THE TIGHTENING: require an explicit version marker (`v`, `@`, `ver`,
 * `version`, or `#`) IMMEDIATELY adjacent to the digits, AND reject a
 * trailing 4th dot-group (`(?!\.\d)`, an IPv4-shape defense-in-depth layered
 * on top of the marker requirement, in case a marker-adjacent IP ever
 * occurs, e.g. "v10.0.0.1"). Neither an IP address, a plain date, nor a
 * bare "step N.N.N" carries any of these markers in ordinary prose, so all
 * three false-positive classes above no longer extract a token at all —
 * verified empirically (node REPL, this wave's own report) against every
 * named case. The real L1-C1 case ("AgentRecall version 3.5.0" / "AgentRecall
 * version 3.4.41") keeps working: the word "version" IS the marker. See the
 * PART E test suite (`query-memory-pipeline.test.mjs`) for the fixture-level
 * proof of both the false-positive exclusions and the still-detected real
 * case.
 *
 * ACCEPTED RECALL LOSS (code-review LOW note, 2026-09-01, not a regression —
 * precision over recall is this fix's explicit brief): the `(?!\.\d)`
 * IPv4-shape guard also excludes a genuine 4-COMPONENT version string (e.g.
 * a Windows-style "3.5.0.1" vs "3.5.0.2") — the same lookahead cannot tell
 * "this is a 4-octet IP" from "this is a 4-part semver" any more than the
 * plain extractor's digits alone could tell a date from a version. AgentRecall's
 * own versioning (and this stage's own worked example) is 3-part, so this is
 * a narrow, acceptable trade — a missed 4-component version conflict decays
 * away naturally (recency still favors the newer mention); a false-positive
 * IP match would not have.

 *      the digits (e.g. "v3.5.0", "#3.5.0"); `@` optionally allows
 *      whitespace (e.g. "pkg@3.5.0" or "pkg @ 3.5.0"); `ver`/`version` are
 *      whole-word-bounded (so "versioning" never matches as "ver" + "sion")
 *      and allow an optional trailing "." plus whitespace before the digits
 *      ("version 3.5.0", "ver. 3.5.0").
 *   2. `(?!\.\d)` rejects a match immediately followed by a 4th
 *      dot-digit-group — an IPv4 defense-in-depth layered on top of (1), in
 *      case a marker ever directly precedes an IP-shaped run (e.g.
 *      "v10.0.0.1"), which (1) alone would not catch since the marker IS
 *      present there.
 * The captured KEY (group 1: the word/token immediately preceding the
 * marker) is unchanged in spirit from the plain extractor — still "whatever
 * word sits before the version mention", lowercased and stripped to
 * `[a-z0-9_-]` by the caller (matching `grammarConflict`'s own usage
 * pattern, ported verbatim from the plain extractor's callers).
