/**
 * archive-prune.ts — retention pass for the lossless raw archive tier (Wave 2).
 *
 * Companion to archive-write.ts. Bounds ~/.agent-recall growth by gzipping (or
 * removing) raw session segments under journal/archive/raw/ that are BOTH:
 *   (a) older than `olderThanDays` (by file mtime), AND
 *   (b) already CONSUMED — i.e. their mtime is at or before
 *       journal/archive/raw/.consumed.json `lastConsumedAt`.
 *
 * "Consumed" (single agreed definition, shared with advanceConsumeMarker in
 * safety-consolidation.ts): a raw segment whose content has been folded into the
 * palace by the login-free, regex journal→palace consolidation. The marker is
 * advanced monotonically to `now − retentionWindow` by advanceConsumeMarker on
 * the login-free safety pass (the optional dreaming loop MAY also advance it, but
 * is no longer required to — that was the original Wave-5 plan, superseded).
 *
 * The consumed gate is load-bearing: while `lastConsumedAt` is null (nothing
 * advanced the marker yet) this pass prunes NOTHING — we never discard raw bytes
 * that have not been distilled into the palace.
 *
 * Mirrors journal-archive.ts's older_than_days / dry-run shape. Unlike
 * archive-write.ts (which must never throw inside the Stop turn), this is an
 * explicitly-invoked maintenance op: it surfaces no error to the caller but
 * skips any single file it cannot process rather than aborting the whole pass.
