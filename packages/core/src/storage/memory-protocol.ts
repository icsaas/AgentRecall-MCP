## Two-tier memory with a bridge

\`\`\`
journal/archive/raw/      ← MECHANICAL ARCHIVE (lossless, verbatim, never lost)
                            appended on EVERY session end, zero judgment.
awareness / palace skills ← QUALITY COMPRESSION (lossy, reasoned)
                            distilled by the async dreaming loop, NOT in the Stop turn.
\`\`\`

When the compressed tier is **not confident**, retrieval drills DOWN into the
lossless archive instead of answering thinly (the bridge).

## Folder layout

- \`journal/\` — curated session stream (capped excerpts; the working narrative).
- \`journal/archive/raw/<date>--<sessionId>.md\` — verbatim session dumps. Each
  file has small frontmatter (\`project, sessionId, savedAt, source\`) then the
  raw transcript head+tail. **Never** synced to any remote.
- \`journal/archive/raw/.consumed.json\` — \`{ lastConsumedOffset, lastConsumedAt }\`.
  The dreaming loop advances this marker as it distills raw segments upward.
- \`journal/archive/index.md\` — one append-only line per dump.
- \`palace/\` — rooms (project knowledge), skills (procedural memory), pipeline,
  awareness (behavioral layer — PERSONAL, sync-excluded by default).
- \`corrections/\` — human corrections (PERSONAL, never synced).

## Consume seam (async dreaming)

Raw dumps are queued for compression, never compressed inside the Stop turn:

\`\`\`
../../.consolidation-queue/<date>.jsonl   ← one JSON job per line, relative
                                            to this file (../.. = the store
                                            root, two levels up from
                                            projects/<slug>/)
\`\`\`

A job looks like \`{ "project", "sessionId", "reason", "at", "done"? }\`.
Drain the queue out-of-band (e.g. \`ar consolidate-async\`): run consolidation
per job, mark each line \`done:true\`. One bad job must never block the rest.

## Cold-agent read/write rules

1. To **read**: prefer the curated \`journal/\` + \`palace/\`. If a hit is
   low-confidence, open the matching \`journal/archive/raw/\` file verbatim.
2. To **write a session**: append a verbatim file under \`journal/archive/raw/\`
   keyed on the session UUID (idempotent), then enqueue a consolidation job.
3. **Never** sync \`awareness\`, \`corrections\`, \`personal/\`, or \`_global\` palace
   to any remote without an explicit \`sync_personal=true\` opt-in.
