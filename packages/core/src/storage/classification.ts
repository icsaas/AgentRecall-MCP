// Wave 1 — Privacy classification: the SINGLE source of truth for the
// personal-vs-project split. Pure, no IO.
//
// Two disjoint surfaces, by design:
//   - classifyStore() covers the SYNC surface. `awareness` and `corrections` (and
//     `_global` palace writes) are personal through the Supabase `store` union.
//     `corrections` requires the double opt-in (sync_personal AND sync_corrections)
//     before it flows through syncToSupabase — it is not silently ignored.
//   - classifyPath() covers the GIT/.gitignore surface — corrections,
//     behavior-policies.json, the future `personal/` tier.
//
// Keeping these explicit means the moment someone adds a new personal artifact
// they register it HERE, and the sync gate + (future) .gitignore both honor it.
