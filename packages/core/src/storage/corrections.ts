/**
 * Capture-quality gate — rejects context-free fragments, pure acknowledgments,
 * and text that carries no actionable signal.
 *
 * v3 (2026-06-21, Loop 8): the ACTIONABLE-signal scan now runs over the FULL
 * text AND each decimal-safe sentence fragment — accepting if ANY fragment
 * carries an imperative/modal/preference marker. This fixes the Loop-7 root
 * cause where the gate only ever saw the truncated first sentence
 * (`text.split(/[.\n]/)[0].slice(0,100)`), discarding ~60% of genuine soft
 * corrections whose directive lived in sentence 2 (e.g. "No, that's wrong.
 * Don't use dark backgrounds.") or whose first sentence was chopped by a
 * decimal ("Show BOTH Opus 4.7 and 4.8" → "Show BOTH Opus 4").
 *
 * PRECISION FLOOR: the HARD noise gates run FIRST, on the WHOLE text — these can
 * never be rescued by the actionable scan:
 *  1. too-short (< 12 chars).
 *  2. system/tool fragment: starts with '<', pure number, bare file path.
 *  3. doc/report/transcript header (starts with '#', a report/mission title,
 *     or a file:// URL) — pasted artifacts, never a behavioral rule.
 *
 * Then the ACTIONABLE-signal scan runs over the FULL text + each fragment. A
 * text that OPENS like an acknowledgment ("No, that's wrong …") is RESCUED only
 * if a fragment carries a genuine directive (the Loop-7 leak: "No, that's wrong.
 * Don't use dark backgrounds." → fragment 2 "Don't use …" is a real rule).
 *
 * Finally the SOFT acknowledgment gate rejects pure acks that the actionable
 * scan did NOT rescue (bare "ok sure", "no that's not what I meant"). Because it
 * runs AFTER the actionable scan, it can no longer eat a genuine correction that
 * merely opens with "no" — but a content-free ack still has no directive to
 * rescue it, so it is still dropped. The marker set is TIGHT (dropped the v2
 * loose "verb-ish anywhere" path) so a long prose blob with no real directive
 * is NOT re-admitted just because it contains a generic verb.
 *
 * Returns { ok: true } when the text passes, or { ok: false, reason } explaining
 * which gate fired. Callers may surface the reason in a warning.

 *      use (05b3699) — so a rebuild-apply can never race a live recordOutcome
