 * Returns true if a filename is a "real" journal entry (not a capture log,

 * scans journal directories.
 *
 * W2-2 (naming-v2 spec §4, 2026-07-20): also excludes any underscore-prefixed
 * file (`_index.md` and any future materialized-index/marker file). Without
 * this, the new `journal/_index.md` machine fast-path would itself be counted
 * as a journal entry by every consumer of this filter — reproducing the
 * exact v3.4.26 "inflated session count" bug class. Verified call sites:
 *   - tools-logic/session-start.ts (session/resume counting) — already safe
 *     by construction (each loop also requires a leading YYYY-MM-DD date
 *     match before counting, and "_index.md" never matches that), but the
 *     underscore guard is added here too as the single source of truth.
 *   - tools-logic/project-board.ts — NOT independently safe: it takes
 *     `files[0]` after `.sort().reverse()` with NO secondary date-match
 *     check. Since "_" (0x5F) sorts AFTER any digit, an un-excluded
 *     "_index.md" would become `files[0]` post-reverse, its date-match would
 *     fail, and the project would be silently DROPPED from the board — a
 *     worse regression than miscounting. This guard is the actual fix for
 *     that path (see regression test in materialized-indexes.test.mjs).
 *   - tools-logic/recognition-builder.ts — safe by construction (same
 *     per-item date-match pattern as session-start.ts) but covered anyway.
 *   - storage/project.ts's own local `isJournalFile` copy already requires a
 *     leading date match (`/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/.test(f)`), so it is
 *     independently safe and was intentionally left unchanged.

// 2026-08-20 — see reports/2026-08-20-identity-trust-review.md).
//
// `isJournalFile` above filters by FILENAME only — it cannot distinguish a
// working-memory-rescue card from a genuine hook-end card, because
// `storage/session-card.ts`'s single `writeSessionCard` writes BOTH under
// the exact same `<date>--card--<sid>.md` naming convention. The only
// distinguishing signal is the frontmatter `source: working-memory-rescue`
// tag set by `storage/working-memory.ts`'s `distillOneSession` — a card
// filed under an unauthenticated, self-claimed `cwd` majority-vote rather
// than a verified identity signal.
//
// Before this fix, that tag was checked in exactly ONE place
// (`tools-logic/resurrect.ts`'s Source 1/Source 3 loops) — every OTHER
// generic consumer of a journal directory's file content (journalSearch,
// smart_recall's journal source via journalSearch, session-start's
// "recent journal briefs"/"resume" readers and its continuity ledger read,
// palace consolidation) read the same on-disk artifact with zero awareness
// of the tag, so a planted rescue card surfaced unmarked, unranked, at #1 —
// exactly the class-completeness gap the review's CRITICAL-1 finding
// describes ("3 prior waves each missed same-class members").
//
// THE FIX: a single tag constant + two tiny predicates, exported from here
// (this module's own header already establishes it as "the single source of
// truth" for journal file conventions — used everywhere a journal directory
// is scanned). Every reader — file-content OR ledger-entry — funnels its
// `source`/frontmatter value through `isRescueSourceTag`, and every GENERIC
// file-content reader additionally funnels raw content through
// `isRescueSourcedContent` and skips the file outright. `resurrect()` is the
// SOLE documented exception: it explicitly wants rescue cards visible
// (ranked strictly below genuine memory, per its own two-tier sort) rather
// than excluded, so it calls `isRescueSourceTag` directly on its own
// already-parsed frontmatter/ledger row instead of the content-level
// predicate. See packages/core/test/identity-trust-completeness.test.mjs
// for the enumerated call-site list and non-vacuity proof.
