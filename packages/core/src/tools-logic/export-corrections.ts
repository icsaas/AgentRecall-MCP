/**
 * export-corrections.ts — the vendor-neutral, fail-closed-scrubbed export of
 * corrections (backlog #1, revealed by the Hindsight integration).
 *
 * WHY: before this, the only way to get active corrections out of AgentRecall was
 * to glob the on-disk JSON directly (schema-coupled, re-implements the scrub that
 * WILL drift) or `ar recall` (drops severity/weight/recurrence). Every external
 * memory backend (Hindsight, Mem0, Zep) had to re-port the egress scrub. This is
 * the ONE supported export contract: a stable versioned schema, scrubbed through
 * the FAIL-CLOSED scrubForExport (a surviving secret aborts the export, never
 * leaks), active-only by default (never teach an external store a retracted
 * belief).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY VENDOR-NEUTRAL: this emits the generic CorrectionExport shape, NOT
 * a Hindsight/Mem0-specific payload — the vendor mapping belongs in the adapter,
 * not in AgentRecall core.
