 * list pulled late, we push a correction-derived PRIOR above it: "this resembles
 * a past correction — check before proceeding." Memory becoming understanding.
 *
 * Pure + exported so it is unit-testable WITHOUT spawning the CLI. The CLI passes
 * in the prompt, the project's P0 corrections, and the awareness blind-spots.
 *
 * Overlap gate starts STRICT (>=2 content tokens) to avoid noise (Risk #8). The
 * tokenizer/overlap grammar is REUSED from check-action.ts — do not fork it.
