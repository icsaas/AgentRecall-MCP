 * the project the caller is currently in, or orientation from elsewhere".
 *
 * Continuity is deliberately cross-project (F2, continuity wave
 * 2026-07-31) — this function does not scope/filter anything, it only
 * answers a labeling question so a caller/renderer can DISTINGUISH "your

 * presenting every entry identically. Every cross-project entry keeps
 * surfacing regardless of what this returns (the shipped cross-project
 * contract in session-start-continuity.test.mjs is untouched by this
 * function's existence).
 *
 * Used at TWO call sites that must stay in lockstep instead of drifting:
 *  1. sessionStart()'s own continuity assembly, to COMPUTE the
 *     `is_current_project` field on each entry at construction time (called
 *     with an entry that has no `is_current_project` yet, so it always
 *     falls through to the slug comparison below).
 *  2. Renderers (MCP formatTerse, CLI hook-start), to READ the label —
 *     trusting the precomputed field when present, falling back to the
 *     identical slug comparison for any entry that predates this field
 *     (e.g. a hand-built SessionStartResult fixture in a renderer's own
 *     unit test) so three renderers never re-implement three slightly
 *     different versions of "slug === currentSlug".
 *
 * A null/empty/undefined entry slug is treated as NOT the current project
 * (never crashes on a malformed ledger row, never false-positives a match
 * between two empty strings) — compares the RESOLVED current slug (the
 * caller's `slug` after `resolveProject()`), never raw unresolved input.
