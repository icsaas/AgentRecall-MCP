/**
 * safety-consolidation.ts — the LOGIN-FREE, LLM-FREE background safety pass.
 *
 * The operator's #1 priority: the three maintenance steps that keep memory
 * healthy (FSRS/salience decay, raw-archive retention, candidate graduation)
 * must run AUTOMATICALLY and WITHOUT a Claude login or any OPENAI_API_KEY.
 *
 * Before this module those steps only fired when the un-cron'd overnight
 * dreaming agent drained the async queue (`ar consolidate-async`), which fails
 * often — so decay rarely ran, pruneRawArchive had ZERO callers (the archive
 * grew unbounded), and crystallization candidates never graduated.
 *
 * This pass wires the EXISTING, already-headless primitives together:
 *   (a) decay     → consolidateJournalToPalace (runs runDecayPass + markKeystones
 *                   internally; pure regex/fs, no LLM)
 *   (b) prune     → pruneRawArchive (the dead retention pass), gated by the
 *                   `.consumed.json` marker which this pass advances by the
 *                   deterministic "older than the retention window ⇒ distilled"
 *                   rule (monotonic ⇒ idempotent)
 *   (c) graduate  → findCrystallizationCandidates + a DETERMINISTIC threshold
 *                   rule that re-titles the strongest member `CRYSTALLIZED: …`.
 *                   No LLM-authored summary — that stays the optional dreaming
 *                   path. Idempotent because findCrystallizationCandidates
 *                   excludes already-CRYSTALLIZED titles.
 *                   NOTE (sync side effect): when a candidate actually graduates,
 *                   this step persists the mutated awareness state and calls
 *                   renderAwareness, which (via writeAwareness) fires a GATED,
 *                   non-blocking Supabase sync of the awareness markdown. The
 *                   sync is a no-op unless Supabase is configured AND sync_enabled
 *                   (readSupabaseConfig returns null otherwise), so it never
 *                   requires a network round-trip or a login to complete the pass
 *                   — it does NOT violate the login-free contract below. dryRun
 *                   and "nothing graduated" paths perform NO write and NO sync.
 *
 * HARD contract:
 *   - NONE of the three steps may require an LLM / OPENAI_API_KEY / Claude login.
 *   - EACH step is wrapped in its own try/catch so one throwing does NOT abort
 *     the others (best-effort, per-step isolation).
 *   - dryRun computes counts but writes NOTHING.
